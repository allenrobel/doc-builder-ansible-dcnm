# Documentation builder for ansible-dcnm modules

This repo contains scripts to convert the DOCUMENTATION section of
Ansible module scripts (consisting of YAML) to Markdown format
amenable for display with Material for Mkdocs.

## Layout

### build_docs.bash

This executes `docbuilder.py` which converts the YAML files
in `./yaml` to the markdown files in `./docs`.

### commit_docs.bash

This copies the markdown files in `./docs` to a separate repo
linked to allenrobel.github.io where the documentation lives
online.

### docbuilder.py

This does the actual conversion.

### docs

Contains the markdown generated by `build_docs.bash`.

### yaml

Contains YAML extracted from the DOCUMENTATION section of the
Ansible module scripts located at:

[Modules](https://github.com/CiscoDevNet/ansible-dcnm/tree/develop/plugins/modules)

### ut

Contains a test YAML file that features the challenging bits of YAML that
we've encountered so far.  If this can be converted to Markdown, then we
should be good.

## Building the docs

``` bash
./build_docs.bash
./commit_docs.bash
```
