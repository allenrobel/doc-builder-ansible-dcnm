# Unit tests

This directory contains unit tests for the documentation builder.

## Layout

### build_docs_ut.bash

build_docs_ut.bash does the following.

1. Executes `../doc_getter.py --unit-test` which (for each module)
    - Retrieves the module code from the ./ut/py directory
    - Saves the DOCUMENTATION docstring into ./documentation
    - Saves the EXAMPLES docstring into ./examples
    - Saves the RETURN docstring into ./return

2. Executes `../doc_builder.py` which (for each module)
    -   Converts the DOCUMENTATION for the module
        (in ./documentation) to the markdown files in `./docs`.
    -   Appends the EXAMPLES docstring for the module
        (in ./examples) to the markdown file in `./docs`.
    -   Appends the RETURN docstring (if any) for the module
        (in ./return) to the markdown file in `./docs`.

### docs

Contains the markdown generated by `../build_docs.bash`.

### documentation

Contains YAML extracted from the DOCUMENTATION section of the
unit test scripts located in ./py

### examples

Contains YAML extracted from the EXAMPLES section of the 
unit test scripts located in ./py

### return

Contains YAML extracted from the RETURN section of the 
unit test scripts located in ./py

### py

Contains a test module file that features the challenging bits of YAML that
we've encountered so far.  If this can be converted to Markdown, then we
should be good.
