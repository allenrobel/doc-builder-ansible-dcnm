# States:
# This module supports the following states:
#
# Merged:
#   Images defined in the playbook will be merged into the controller.
#
#   The images listed in the playbook will be created if not already present on the server
#   server. If the image is already present and the configuration information included
#   in the playbook is either different or not present in server, then the corresponding
#   information is added to the server. If an image mentioned in playbook
#   is already present on the server and there is no difference in configuration, no operation
#   will be performed for such interface.
#
# Overridden:
#   Images defined in the playbook will be overridden in the controller.
#
#   The state of the images listed in the playbook will serve as source of truth for all
#   the images on the controller. Additions and deletions will be done to bring
#   the images on the controller to the state listed in the playbook. All images other than the
#   ones mentioned in the playbook will be deleted.
#   Note: Override will work on the all the images present in the controller.
#
# Deleted:
#   Images defined in the playbook will be deleted from the controller.
#
#   Deletes the list of images specified in the playbook. If the playbook does not include
#   any image information, then all images from the controller will be deleted.
#
# Query:
#   Returns the current state for the images listed in the playbook.
