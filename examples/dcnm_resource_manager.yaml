# Entity name format
# ==================
#
# The format of the entity name depends on the scope_type of the resource being allocated.

# Scope Type                Entity Name
# =====================================
# Fabric                    Eg: My_Network_30000
# Device                    Eg: loopback0
# Device Pair               Eg: FDO21331S8T~FDO21332E6X~vPC1
# Device Interface          Eg: FDO21332E6X~Ethernet1/13
# Link                      Eg: FDO21332E6X~Ethernet1/3~FDO21331S8T~Ethernet1/3

# where FDO21331S8T and FDO21331S8T are switch serial numbers

# This module supports the following states:

# Merged:
#   Resources defined in the playbook will be merged into the target fabric.
#     - If the Resources does not exist it will be added.
#     - If the Resources exists but properties managed by the playbook are different
#       they will be updated if possible.
#     - Resources that are not specified in the playbook will be untouched.
#
# Deleted:
#   Resources defined in the playbook will be deleted.
#
# Query:
#   Returns the current DCNM state for the Resources listed in the playbook.
