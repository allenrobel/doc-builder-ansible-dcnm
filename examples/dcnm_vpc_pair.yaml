# States:
# This module supports the following states:
#
# Merged:
#   VPC switch pairs defined in the playbook will be merged into the target fabric.
#
#   The VPC switch pairs listed in the playbook will be created if not already present on the DCNM
#   server. If the VPC switch pair is already present and the configuration information included
#   in the playbook is either different or not present in DCNM, then the corresponding
#   information is added to the DCNM. If a VPC switch pair  mentioned in playbook
#   is already present on DCNM and there is no difference in configuration, no operation
#   will be performed for such switch pairs.
#
# Replaced:
#   VPC switch pairs defined in the playbook will be replaced in the target fabric.
#
#   The state of the VPC switch pairs listed in the playbook will serve as source of truth for the
#   same VPC switch pairs present on the DCNM under the fabric mentioned. Additions and updations
#   will be done to bring the DCNM VPC switch pairs to the state listed in the playbook.
#   Note: Replace will only work on the VPC switch pairs mentioned in the playbook.
#
# Overridden:
#   VPC switch pairs defined in the playbook will be overridden in the target fabric.
#
#   The state of the VPC switch pairs listed in the playbook will serve as source of truth for all
#   the VPC switch pairs under the fabric mentioned. Additions and deletions will be done to bring
#   the DCNM VPC switch pairs to the state listed in the playbook. All VPC switch pairs other than the
#   ones mentioned in the playbook will be deleted.
#   Note: Override will work on the all the VPC switch pairs present in the DCNM Fabric.
#
# Deleted:
#   VPC switch pairs defined in the playbook will be deleted in the target fabric.
#
#   Deletes the list of VPC switch pairs specified in the playbook.  If the playbook does not include
#   any VPC switch pair information, then all VPC switch pairs from the fabric will be deleted.
#
# Query:
#   Returns the current DCNM state for the VPC switch pairs listed in the playbook.
