# L4-L7 Service Insertion:
#
# Cisco DCNM has the ability to insert Layer 4-Layer 7 (L4-L7) service devices in a data center fabric, and also enables selectively
# redirecting traffic to these service devices. You can add a service node, create route peering between the service node and the
# service leaf switch, and then selectively redirect traffic to these service nodes. Ansible collections support 3 modules viz.
# Service Node, Service Route Peering and Service Policy to enable this.
#
# Service Node:
#
# You have to create an external fabric and specify that a service node resides in that external fabric during service node creation.
# Service policies are created on the service node to determine the actions to be applied to the traffic
#
# Route Peerings:
#
# Multiple Service Route Peerings can be created under service node. Each Route Peering creates required service networks that is used to
# carry traffic towards the service node.
#
# Service Policy:
#
# Each route peering can have multiple service policies. Service policies can only be created for networks created through route peerings.
# The service policies define the actions to be taken for matching traffic.
#
# Dependency Tree:
#
# Service Node
# |
# |---- Route Peering 1
# |     |
# .     |---- Service Policy 1
# .     |
# .     .
# .     .
# .     .
# .     |---- Service Policy N
# .
# |---- Route Peering N
#       |
#       |---- Service Policy 1
#       |
#       .
#       .
#       .
#       |---- Service Policy N
#
# This module supports the following states:
#
# Merged:
#   Service Nodes defined in the playbook will be merged into the service fabric.
#     - If the service node does not exist it will be added.
#     - If the service node exists but properties managed by the playbook are different
#       they will be updated if possible.
#     - Service Nodes that are not specified in the playbook will be untouched.
#
# Replaced:
#   Service Nodes defined in the playbook will be replaced in the service fabric.
#     - If the service node does not exist it will be added.
#     - If the service node exists but properties managed by the playbook are different
#       they will be updated if possible.
#     - Properties that can be managed by the module but are not specified
#       in the playbook will be deleted or defaulted if possible.
#     - Service Nodes that are not specified in the playbook will be untouched.
#
# Overridden:
#   Service Node defined in the playbook will be overridden in the service fabric.
#     - If the service node does not exist it will be added.
#     - If the service node exists but properties managed by the playbook are different
#       they will be updated if possible.
#     - Properties that can be managed by the module but are not specified
#       in the playbook will be deleted or defaulted if possible.
#     - Service Nodes that are not specified in the playbook will be deleted.
#
# Deleted:
#   Service Node defined in the playbook will be deleted.
#   If no Service Nodes are provided in the playbook, all service node present on that DCNM fabric will be deleted.
#
# Query:
#   Returns the current DCNM state for the service node listed in the playbook.
