# States:
# This module supports the following states:
#
# Merged:
#   Interfaces defined in the playbook will be merged into the target fabric.
#
#   The interfaces listed in the playbook will be created if not already present on the DCNM
#   server. If the interface is already present and the configuration information included
#   in the playbook is either different or not present in DCNM, then the corresponding
#   information is added to the interface on DCNM. If an interface mentioned in playbook
#   is already present on DCNM and there is no difference in configuration, no operation
#   will be performed for such interface.
#
# Replaced:
#   Interfaces defined in the playbook will be replaced in the target fabric.
#
#   The state of the interfaces listed in the playbook will serve as source of truth for the
#   same interfaces present on the DCNM under the fabric mentioned. Additions and updations
#   will be done to bring the DCNM interfaces to the state listed in the playbook.
#   Note: Replace will only work on the interfaces mentioned in the playbook.
#
# Overridden:
#   Interfaces defined in the playbook will be overridden in the target fabric.
#
#   The state of the interfaces listed in the playbook will serve as source of truth for all
#   the interfaces under the fabric mentioned. Additions and deletions will be done to bring
#   the DCNM interfaces to the state listed in the playbook. All interfaces other than the
#   ones mentioned in the playbook will either be deleted or reset to default state.
#   Note: Override will work on the all the interfaces present in the DCNM Fabric.
#
# Deleted:
#   Interfaces defined in the playbook will be deleted in the target fabric.
#
#   Deletes the list of interfaces specified in the playbook.  If the playbook does not include
#   any switches or interface information, then all interfaces from all switches in the
#   fabric will either be deleted or put to default state. If configuuration includes information
#   pertaining to any particular switch, then interfaces belonging to that switch will either be
#   deleted or put to default. If configuration includes both interface and switch information,
#   then the specified interfaces will either be deleted or reset on all the seitches specified
#
# Query:
#   Returns the current DCNM state for the interfaces listed in the playbook.
