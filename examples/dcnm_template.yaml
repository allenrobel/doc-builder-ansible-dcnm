# States:
# This module supports the following states:
#
# Merged:
#   Templates defined in the playbook will be merged into the target.
#
#   The templates listed in the playbook will be created if not already present on the DCNM
#   server. If the template is already present and the configuration information included
#   in the playbook is either different or not present in DCNM, then the corresponding
#   information is added to the template on DCNM. If a template mentioned in playbook
#   is already present on DCNM and there is no difference in configuration, no operation
#   will be performed for such a template.
#
# Deleted:
#   Templates defined in the playbook will be deleted from the target.
#
#   Deletes the list of templates specified in the playbook.
#
# Query:
#   Returns the current DCNM state for the templates listed in the playbook.
